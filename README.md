# t_test
This git has examples of  "T-Test" in Python:

* Paired T-Test
* (non-paired) T-Test
* Equivalence Paired T-Test

T-Tests are a scientifically accepted, rigorous way to assign statistical to experiments.  For example:

* Show the performance of machine learning algorithm "X" is superior to machine learning algorithm "Y"
* Show that Version 2.0 of an algorithm produces results that are the same as Version 1.0 (very important in certain cases)
* Show that a sensor embedded in a robotic system performs at the same level as one in a (vendor-calibrated) bench environment.

References and Python code in the notebooks. Enjoy!
